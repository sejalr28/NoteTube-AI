----------
Pydantic models define the "shape" of data flowing in and out of our API.

Why this matters for an AI/ML backend:
FastAPI uses these models to automatically:
  1. Validate incoming request data (e.g. reject a request with no URL)
  2. Serialize outgoing responses into consistent JSON
  3. Generate interactive API docs at /docs

Keeping all schemas in one file makes it easy to see the full "API contract"
at a glance.
