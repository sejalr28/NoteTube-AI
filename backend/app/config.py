config.py
----------
Centralized application configuration.

Why this file exists:
Instead of scattering `os.getenv(...)` calls across the codebase, we load
all environment variables ONCE here using pydantic-settings. This gives us:
  - Type validation (e.g. CHUNK_SIZE is guaranteed to be an int)
  - A single source of truth for tunable parameters
  - Easy access anywhere via `from app.config import settings`

This is a common real-world pattern in production FastAPI apps.
